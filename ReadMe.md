# Breast Cancer Diagnosis 

Coursework for CM50264 Machine Learning 1 (Semester 1, 2021) at University of Bath.

Grade: 15/15 (Distinction)

## Objective

A decision tree model is to be built to determine whether a tumor is malignant or benign given 10 attributes listed below. 

|Attribute ID|Description|
|--|--|
|X1|Radius|
|X2|Texture|
|X3|Perimeter|
|X4|Area|
|X5|Smoothness|
|X6|Compactness|
|X7|Concavity|
|X8|Concave points|
|X9|Symmetry|
|X10|Fractal dimension|

The data used in this coursework is from the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28original%29).

## Model performance

The decision tree algorithm is written from scratch and achieves a test accuracy of 91.67%.
